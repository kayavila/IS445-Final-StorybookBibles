This project is a collaboration between Kay Avila, an UIUC iSchool IS 445 student, and Dr. Melody Green, a professor at the Urbana Theological Seminary.  Dr. Green is researching children’s storybook bibles.  </p><h2 id="children’s-storybook-bibles">Children’s Storybook Bibles</h2><p>Storybook bibles are illustrated retellings of stories from the Christian Bible, intended for children as their audience.</p><p>Below are the covers from a few of the books in this dataset:</p><div class="idyll-stepper" style="position:relative;height:500px"><div class="idyll-step-graphic"><div class="idyll-graphic"><img src="static/images/book0.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/></div></div><div class="idyll-step-content"><div class="idyll-step "><a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL11586361M/Precious_Moments_Bible_Classics">OpenLibrary: Precious Moments Bible Classics </a></div></div><div class="idyll-stepper-control"><div class="idyll-stepper-control-button idyll-stepper-control-button-previous">←</div><div class="idyll-stepper-control-button idyll-stepper-control-button-next">→</div></div></div><h2 id="dataset-creation">Dataset Creation</h2><span class="aside-container"><span class="aside"><div class="idyll-graphic"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.urbanatheologicalseminary.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Melody-Green.jpg"/><div style="font-size:12px;align:center" idyll="[object Object]">Dr. Green’s faculty photo on the <a href="https://www.urbanatheologicalseminary.org/">UTS website</a>.</div></div></span></span><p>Dr. Green went through her collection of physical books and provided the ISBNs for all of the books  From there, Kay wrote a <div style="display:inline"> <div class="annotated-text">few python scripts <!-- --> <div class="annotation-text"><div class="idyll-graphic"><span>These scripts resolved the book data using the OpenLibrary and ISBN DB service APIs.  The scripts themselves are available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/kayavila/isbn-indexer.">https://github.com/kayavila/isbn-indexer.</a></span></div></div></div> </div> to download information about the books and create a dataset about Dr. Green’s collection.  She also used <a href="https://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a> to clean up the data and attempt to make it more consistent.</p><p>The information about each book includes:</p><ul><li>ISBN</li><li>Title</li><li>First author and any other authors</li><li>First illustrators and any other illustrators</li><li>Publisher</li><li>Publisher location</li><li>Year published</li><li>Number of pages</li><li>MSRP</li></ul><p>
However, not all of the data is complete, as not all information was available for all books.  Dr. Green ultimately hopes to use some of the statistical information about this dataset within her publications, though it will require additional manual labor to double-check the information from the ISBN databases against the information in the books themselves.</p><h2 id="exploration">Exploration</h2><h3 id="number-of-books-published-by-year">Number of Books Published by Year</h3><p>Most of the books in the collection were published between 1980 and 2015, with the number gradually increasing by year published.</p><div></div><section><p>
Lowest Year: 1950 <input type="range" value="1950" min="1950" max="2020" step="1"/> 2022</p><p>Highest Year: 1950 <input type="range" value="2020" min="1950" max="2022" step="1"/> 2022</p></section><h3 id="number-of-pages-versus-price">Number of Pages Versus Price</h3><p>MSRP stands for “manufacturer suggested retail price,” or the price that the publisher suggests the book should be sold at.</p><p>Within the collection, the number of pages seems roughly correlated with the suggested price.  However, a lot of the data for the number of pages seems missing.</p><div></div><h3 id="top-ten-values">Top Ten Values</h3><p>There are also a number of interesting “top ten” values, such as the top ten most profilic authors or illustrators in the collection, and the top ten most common publication locations.</p><p>These were generated with pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter notebook.<div class="idyll-stepper" style="position:relative;height:500px"><div class="idyll-step-graphic"><div class="idyll-graphic"><img src="static/images/stats0.png" idyll="[object Object]"/></div></div><div class="idyll-step-content"><div class="idyll-step "></div></div><div class="idyll-stepper-control"><div class="idyll-stepper-control-button idyll-stepper-control-button-previous">←</div><div class="idyll-stepper-control-button idyll-stepper-control-button-next">→</div></div></div></p><h3 id="wordcloud">Wordcloud</h3><p>Finally, it can be interesting to look at a body of text and visualize the relative frequences of words appearing using a word cloud.</p><p>We can see that the word “Bible” appears the most often, closely followed by “First”.  Other common words include “Pretty”, “Candle”, and “Stories”.</p><p>This was generated using pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter notebook, and Andreas Mueller’s WordCloud python library.</p><div class="idyll-graphic"><img src="static/images/wordcloud.png"/></div><h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3><p>Aside from reviewing the dataset for accuracy and manually filling in the missing information, Dr. Green will be directing the next steps for what data she would like to see visualized, based on the findings from this initial exploration.</p><h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3><p>Thank you to Dr. Melody Green for providing the use case and ISBNs for this project.</p></div></div></div></div>
